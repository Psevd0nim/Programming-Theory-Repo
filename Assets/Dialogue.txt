Hello, stranger! Be careful! These lands are dangerous!
Look ahead, enemy is coming. Press "Space" to jump over him and keep going!
Oops! Seems like someone forgot to bind "Jump Key".
Can you help with it?
Thank you!
This is enemy is very fast. We don't have enough velocity. We need to move a little faster. Let's bind a new Key for Sprint.
